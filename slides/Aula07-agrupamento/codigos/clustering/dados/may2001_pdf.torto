 INTRODUCTION 
 Increasing sources and amounts of information challenge 
 users around the globe .  Broadcast new sources and 
 newspapers provide society with the vast majority of 
 real�time information .  Unfortunately ,  cost efficiencies 
 and real�time pressures demand that producers ,  editors 
 and writers select and organize content for stereotypical 
 audiences .  In this paper we illustrate how content 
 understanding ,  user modeling ,  and tailored presentation 
 generation promise personalcasts on demand .  
 NEWS ON DEMAND 
 People are daily offered vast quantities of news in the 
 form of multiple media  ( text ,  audio ,  video )  .  For the past 
 several years ,  a community of scientists has been 
 developing news on demand algorithms and technologies 
 to provide more convenient access to broadcast news 
  ( Maybury      )  .  Applications promising on�demand 
 access to multimedia information such as radio and 
 broadcast news on a broad range of computing platforms 
  ( e.g .  kiosk ,  mobile phone ,  PDA )  offer new engineering 
 challenges .  Systems have been developed that 
 automatically index ,  cluster/organize ,  and extract 
 information from news .  Synergistic processing of 
 speech ,  language and image/gesture promise both 
 enhanced interaction at the interface and enhanced 
 understanding of artifacts such as web ,  radio ,  and 
 television sources  ( Maybury      )  .  Coupled with user 
 and discourse modeling ,  new services such as delivery of 
 intelligent instruction and individually tailored 
 personalcasts become possible .  
 BROADCAST NEWS NAVIGATOR 
 To illustrate personalcasting ,  we describe the Broadcast 
 News Navigator  ( BNN )  .  In our research ,  we have 
 created a system that exploits video ,  audio ,  and closed 
 caption text information sources to automatically 
 segment ,  extract ,  and summarize news programs 
  ( Maybury ,  Merlino ,  and Morey      )  .  Figure  
shows 
 the results of BNN responding to a user query requesting 
 all reports regarding  Cuba  
between   
May and June 
    ,       .  For each story matching the query ,  the system 
 presents a key frame ,  the three most frequent named 
 entities within the story ,  and the source and date of the 
 story .  
 Figure   .  Automated Retrieval of Stories about Cuba 
 This ,  in essence ,  provides the user with a  Cuba  
channel 
 of information ,  personalizing the channel to their 
 information interests .  Moreover ,  the user can create 
 arbitrarily complex queries combining key words ,  named 
 entities  ( e.g .  ,  people ,  organizations ,  locations )  ,  source 
  ( e.g .  ,  CNN ,  MS�NBC ,  ABC )  or time intervals  ( e.g .  ,  
 specific days ,  weeks or years )  .  These queries result in 
 selected video stories specific to their interest .  
 The user can then select any of the key frames to get 
 access to details of the story ,  such as shown in Figure   .  
 In this presentation ,  the user has access to all of the 
 people ,  organizations and locations mentioned in the 
 story ,  an automatically extracted one line summary of the 
 news  ( the sentence with the most frequent named 
 entities )  ,  a key frame extracted from the story segment ,  
 and a pointer to the full closed caption text and video 
 source for review .  An empirical evaluations reported in 
 Merlino and Maybury  (      )  demonstrated that users 
 could enhance their retrieval performance  ( a weighted 
 combination of precision and recall )  by utilizing BNN s

 performance ,  users reported user satisfaction  (  
dislike ,  
   
like )  of   .   
 ( for retrieval )  and   .   
for mixed 
 media display  ( e.g .  ,  story skim ,  story details )  .

 The system provides navigation support ,  so that the user 
 can select named entities and find stories including them .  
 Further ,  by employing a clustering algorithm ,  the system 
 enables the user to select stories similar to the current 
 story .  
 USER MODELING AND TAILORING 
 The control flow diagram in Figure  
shows a traditional 
 search session in BNN .  They user poses a query and 
 receives a story skim of the kind shown in Figure   .  The 
 user then selects a story and is provided the details as 
 exemplified in Figure   .  From this story detail ,  the user 
 can simply review the summary and all named entities or 
 explicitly choose a media element to display ,  such as the 
 full video source or the text transcript .  However ,  each of 
 these user actions affords an opportunity for modeling 
 user interest .  User interest profiles can be created from 
 explicit and/or implicit user input and then used to tailor 
 presentations to the user s interests and preferences .  
 As shown in Figure   ,  in BNN the user can explicitly 
 define a user profile by defining simple keywords ,  or 
 semantic entities such as individuals ,  locations ,  or 
 organizations indicating their interest .  They can also 
 specify preferred broadcast sources to search  ( e.g .  ,  
 CNN ,  ABC News )  .  This profile could easily be 
 extended to indicate media type preferences for 
 presentation  ( e.g .  ,  key frame only ,  full video ,  text 
 summary )  .  The user s interest profiles can be run 
 periodically and sent to the requester as an alert or story 
 skims or details like those shown in Figures  
and   .  In 
 addition to this explicit collection ,  an implicit method 
 can build an interest model by watching the user session 
 to track the user s query ,  selection of particular stories ,  
 and choice of media .  The system could then build an 
 interest model .  
 Figure   .  Traditional Searching using BNN 
 Because the original broadcast news source is segmented 
 into its component parts ,  key elements are extracted and 
 others are summarized .  This enables a system not only 
 to select stories based on users content interest ,  but also 
 to assemble them in the manner a user prefers .  For 
 example ,  the user could be presented with only key 
 frame ,  with summary sentences ,  with people or place 
 names or with the entire source .  A natural extension of 
 this work would be to add a feedback and collaborative 
 filtering mechanism so that not only would the individual 
 user s model modify with search ,  but the user could 
 benefit from searches performed by others in a 
 community .

 FUTURE RESEARCH 
 Many outstanding research problems must be solved to 
 realize automatically created user tailored news .  
 Important issues include :  
   .  Instrumentation of user applications to automatically 
 log and infer models of user interest .  With users 
 increasingly learning ,  working and playing in digital 
 environments ,  instrumentation of user interactions  ( e.g .  ,

 Linton et al      )  is feasible and has shown value .  In 
 information seeking sessions ,  detecting selections and 
 rejections of information provides an opportunity to 
 induce individual and group profiles that can assist in 
 content selection and presentation generation .  
   .  Tailoring .  More sophisticated mechanisms are 
 required to tailor content to specific topics or users .  In 
 addition to content selection ,  material must be ordered 
 and customized to individual user interests .  This will 
 require methods of presentation generation that integrate 
 extracted or canned text with generated text .  
   .  Information Extraction .  Over the longer term we are 
 working to create techniques to automatically 
 summarize ,  fuse and tailor selected events and stories .  
 This requires deeper understanding of the source news 
 material beyond extracting named entities ,  key frames ,  or 
 key sentences .  
   .  Multilingual content .  Because news is global in 
 production and dissemination ,  it is important to support 
 access to and integration of foreign language content .  
 This poses not only multilingual processing challenges 
 but also requires dealing with different country/cultural 
 structures and formats .  
   .  Cross story fusion .  An important problem is not only 
 summarization of individual stories but summarizing 
 across many stories ,  possibly from difference sources or 
 languages .  This is particularly challenging when the 
 sources may be inconsistent in content or form .  
   .  Persistence/transience of interest profiles .  User 
 information needs tend to change over time ,  with profiles 
 rapidly becoming out of date .  Monitoring user queries 
 and story selections is one method that can address this 
 problem .  Generalizing from their specific interests can 
 yield an even richer user model .  
   .  Evaluation .  Community defined multimedia 
 evaluations will be essential for progress .  Key to this 
 progress will be a shared infrastructure of benchmark 
 tasks with training and test sets to support cross�site 
 performance comparisons .
