	                  system providing users with personalized TV

	                  cold-start  problem of information filtering
	
	                  systems, i.e. that filtering systems have to gather
	
	                  information about the user s interests before they
	
	                  can compute personalized
	
	                  recommendations. Traditionally, gathering this
	
	                  information involves upfront user effort, resulting
	
	                  in a substantial entry barrier. TV Scout is designed
	
	                  to avoid this problem by presenting itself to new
	
	                  users not as a filtering system, but as a retrieval
	
	                  system where all user effort leads to an immediate
	
	                  result. While users are dealing with this retrieval
	
	                  functionality, the system continuously and
	
	                  unobtrusively gathers information about the user
	s
	
	                  interests from implicit feedback and gradually
	
	                  evolves into a filtering system. An analysis of

	                  file data gathered with over 10,000 registered
	
	                  online users shows that over 85\% of all first-time
	
	                  users logged in again, suggesting that the described
	
	                  architecture is successful in lowering the entry

	                  prediction rates, leaving a set of cases for which

	                  issues. First, when maximizing prediction rate is
	
	                  preferable, what mechanisms can be employed such
	
	                  that a system can make more predictions without

	                  contexts in which accuracy is of primary importance,
	
	                  how can we further improve prediction accuracy?
	A
	
	                  recently proposed Dual-model approach, which takes

	                  two classes of Dual-model variant. Each aims to
	
	                  achieve one of the above objectives. With the

	                  which does not utilize the temporal information,
	
	                  empirical evaluations in the domain of elementary
	
	                  subtraction show that one class of variant
	
	                  outperforms the baseline in prediction rate while
	
	                  the other does so in prediction accuracy, without

	                  class of devices called personal video recorders
	
	                  (PVRs). For a PVR to provide an enriched TV
	
	                  experience to the user, personalization is the
	
	                  key. One of the thorny problems facing a recommender
	
	                  system is that of cold-start: how does one capture
	
	                  the user preferences quickly and effectively and
	
	                  provide user-specific personalization
	
	                  "out-of-the-box"? To address the cold-start problem,
	
	                  we propose a stereotype-enabled personalization
	
	                  framework that evolves a user's TV profile from
	a
	
	                  stereotypical, initial profile, to a personalized,
	
	                  more relevant one. The stereotypes have been derived
	
	                  from a sample set of 7 users who have been
	
	                  contributing their TV viewing histories to us for
	
	                  periods ranging from 5 months to 2 years. We
	
	                  conducted 3 sets of experiments, each with a
	
	                  different set of stereotypes applied to all the
	
	                  users. The results show that the average lower and

	                  over all users and stereotypes used in the
	
	                  experiments are 26.7\$ and 37.6\$ respectively.
	The
	
	                  best case performance, in the case of 2 users, is
	in
	
	                  the range of 11\$ error. This performance compares
	
	                  favorably with the best we have got to date on

	                  work presented here, we are concerned with the
	
	                  extraction of meta-knowledge from the Web. In
	
	                  particular, knowledge about Web usage which is
	
	                  invaluable to the construction of Web sites that
	
	                  meet their purposes and prevent
	
	                  disorientation. Towards this goal, we propose the
	
	                  organisation of the users of a Web site into groups
	
	                  with common navigational behaviour (user
	
	                  communities). We view the task of building user
	
	                  communities as a data mining task, searching for
	
	                  interesting patterns within a database. The database
	
	                  that we use in our experiments consists of access
	
	                  logs collected from the Web site of the Advanced
	
	                  Course on Artificial Intelligence 1999. The
	
	                  unsupervised machine learning algorithm COBWEB is
	
	                  used to organise the users of the site, who follow
	
	                  similar paths, into a small set of
	
	                  communities. Particular attention is paid to the
	
	                  interpretation of the communities that are generated
	
	                  through this process. For this purpose, we use a
	
	                  simple metric to identify the representative
	
	                  navigational behaviour for each community. This
	
	                  information can then be used by the administrators
	
	                  of the site to re-organise it in a way that is
	
	                  tailored to the needs of each community. The
	
	                  proposed Web usage analysis is much more insightful

	by exchanging the system service-situation association, by splitting
	the situation, or by learning new roles. The situation split is interpreted
	as a replacement of the former situation by sub-situations whose

	the level of effort required to effectively use existing system to

	useful information often outweighs the perceived benefit of doing
	so.
	
	This thesis is about a software tool called Watson, built to significantly
	
	reduce the level of effort required to find information in the context
	of an
	
	ongoing task. Watson works by analysing the document the user is
	
	reading or writing in everyday productivity applications (e.g., word

	retrieve useful information from any networked information repository
	
	
	(e.g., Internet search engines, enterprise knowledge management systems,
	
	or cystom databases). Using Watson, users can more easily maintain
	an
	
	awareness of available information resources without having to know
	
	wich data repositories to search, or how to formulate a complex query.
	
	
	In order to better understand Watson's effectiveness as a new kind

	access tool, we performed laboratory evaluations and also developed
	it for
	
	use as a pilot in several commercial settings. The deployment experiences

  school = {College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology},
  year = {2000},
  month = {December},
  abstract = {Traditional interactive applications are limited to using only the
	input that users explicitly provide. As users
	
	move away from traditional desktop computing environments and move
	towards mobile and ubiquitous
	
	computing environments, there is a greater need for applications to
	leverage from implicit information, or
	
	context. These types of environments are rich in context, with users
	and devices moving around and
	
	computational services becoming available or disappearing over time.
	This information is usually not
	
	available to applications but can be useful in adapting the way in
	which it performs its services and in
	
	changing the available services. Applications that use context are
	known as context-aware applications.
	
	This research in context-aware computing has focused on the development
	of a software architecture to
	
	support the building of context-aware applications. While developers
	have been able to build context-aware
	
	applications, they have been limited to using a small variety of sensors
	that provide only simple context
	
	such as identity and location. This dissertation presents a set of
	requirements and component abstractions
	
	for a conceptual supporting framework. The framework along with an
	identified design process makes it
	
	easier to acquire and deliver context to applications, and in turn,
	build more complex context-aware
	
	applications.
	
	In addition, an implementation of the framework called the Context
	Toolkit is discussed, along with a
	
	number of context-aware applications that have been built with it.
	The applications illustrate how the
	
	toolkit is used in practice and allows an exploration of the design
	space of context-aware computing. This
	
	dissertation also shows how the Context Toolkit has been used as a
	research testbed, supporting the
	
	investigation of difficult problems in context-aware computing such
	as the building of high-level
	
	programming abstractions, dealing with ambiguous or inaccurate context
	data and controlling access to
	
	personal context.},

	                  interaction research is tomake systems more usable,

	                  fitting their specific background knowledge and
	
	                  objectives. The challenge in an information-rich
	
	                  world is not only to make in-formation available
	to
	
	                  people at any time, at any place, and in any form,
	
	                  but specifically to say the ``right'' thing at the
	
	                  ``right'' time in the ``right'' way. Designers of
	
	                  collaborative human-computer systems face the
	
	                  formidable task of writing software for millions
	of
	
	                  users (at design time) while making it work as if

	                  were designed for each individual user (only known
	
	                  at use time). User modeling research has attempted
	
	                  to address these issues. In this article, I will
	
	                  first review the objectives, progress, and unfulfilled
	
	                  hopes that have occurred over the last ten years,

	                  computational environments and their underlying
	
	                  conceptual frameworks. Aspecial emphasis is given

	                  high-functionality applications and the impact of
	
	                  user modeling to make them more usable, useful,

	                  learnable. Finally, an assessment of the current

  abstract = {Information overload has become a pressing research problem on account
	of the constantly growing amount
	
	of information available from on-line sources such as the Web. In
	the last decade, personal information agents
	
	have emerged as a promising solution to deal with this problem. These
	agents are intelligent assistants that
	
	make different tasks such as finding, accessing, filtering and summarizing
	large amounts of information on
	
	behalf of users and then present a reduced and potentially relevant
	part of this information to users. Personal
	
	agents act as human assistants, collaborating with the user and becoming
	more efficient as they learn about
	
	user interests, preferences and habits.
	
	
	To provide effective personalized assistance, personal agents depend
	on the knowledge about individual users
	
	contained in user profiles, i.e. models of user interests, preferences
	and habits gathered mainly through observation
	
	of user behavior. The accurate representation of user interests is
	crucial to the performance of personal
	
	agents to satisfy user information needs and, consequently, also are
	the learning approach used to acquire user
	
	profiles and the adaptation strategy used to cope with changes in
	the user interests.
	
	
	In spite of the agreement on the importance of user profiling as an
	integral component of personal information
	
	agents, existing user profiling approaches have only partially addressed
	the characteristics that distinguish
	
	profiling from related tasks. In most personal agents, user profiling
	has been casted as either a text classification
	
	or a pure statistical keyword analysis problem. However, acquiring
	representation of user interests embraces
	
	a number of additional aspects, such as modeling specific interest
	topics which are likely to change over time
	
	and modeling contextual information about these interests. Furthermore,
	little attention has been paid to the
	
	assessment of readable descriptions of users interests to be interpreted
	by either users or other agents.
	
	
	In this thesis a novel user profiling technique, named WebPro filer,
	is proposed to support incremental learning
	
	and adaptation of user profiles in personal agents assisting users
	with information related tasks. This
	
	technique aims at acquiring comprehensible user proles that accurately
	capture user interests starting from
	
	observation of user behavior on the Web. It addresses representational
	issues of user profiles, such as the description
	
	of interests at different abstraction levels, the adaptation to changes
	in user interests over time and
	
	the incorporation of contextual information that enables the development
	of context-aware agents.
	
	
	The experiments carried out to validate the proposed technique demonstrate
	that it can not only generate
	
	meaningful descriptions of user interests, but also adapt profiles
	to gradual and abrupt interest changes over
	
	time. In addition, it behaves better in recommendation than previous
	user profiling approaches and enriches
	
	personal agents with the ability of predicting relevant information
	according to the time and activity contexts 
	
	of users. Finally, the application of this technique to a personal
	agent assisting Web search and the extension
	
	of this agent to support collaborative discovery of information in
	a community of agents shown the potential
	
	of the approach for reducing the burden of finding information on
	the Web.},

	documents
	
	[2, 7, 12]. One way to handle large volumes of mail is to provide

	as illustrated in Figure 1,
	
	the set of documents of interest to a particular user rarely map neatly
	to existing lists.
	
	A better solution is for a user to specify afi'lter that scans all

	documents no matter what list they are in. Several mail systems support
	filtering based

	                  randomly chosen individuals, and utilized this data
	
	                  to analyze people's program choices. We categorized
	
	                  the respondents by the similarity of the programs
	
	                  they had watched and examined the groupings that
	
	                  emerged and the features of these groups. From our
	
	                  analysis, it became clear that a  more/less serious
	
	                  and  more/less fictional axes are involved in
	
	                  program selection. Our results show that eight
	
	                  groups (stereotypes) explain viewers contact with
	
	                  television, their motivation for choosing programs
	
	                  to watch, and their interest in matters other than
	
	                  television. Applying these stereotypes to the
	
	                  process of program selection or recommendation will
	
	                  be useful for the future design of personalized

	                  sharing ratings between likeminded persons. However,
	
	                  current recommender systems are black boxes,
	
	                  providing no transparency into the working of the

	                  shows that providing explanations can improve the
	
	                  acceptance of ACF systems. We also describe some

	                  systems for the Web is presented. The described
	
	                  system comprises two main modules, named HUMOS and
	
	                  WIFS. HUMOS is a user modeling system based on
	
	                  stereotypes. It builds and maintains long term
	
	                  models of individual Internet users, representing
	
	                  their information needs. The user model is
	
	                  structured as a frame containing informative words,
	
	                  enhanced with semantic networks. The proposed
	
	                  machine learning approach for the user modeling
	
	                  process is based on the use of an artificial neural
	
	                  network for stereotype assignments. WIFS is a
	
	                  content-based information filtering module, capable
	
	                  of selecting html/text documents on computer science
	
	                  collected from the Web according to the interests
	of
	
	                  the user. It has been created for the very purpose
	
	                  of the structure of the user model utilized
	
	                  by HUMOS. Currently, this system acts as an adaptive
	
	                  interface to the Web search engine ALTA VISTA. An
	
	                  empirical evaluation of the system has been made
	in
	
	                  experimental settings. The experiments focused on
	
	                  the evaluation, by means of a non-parametric
	
	                  statistics approach, of the added value in terms
	of
	
	                  system performance given by the user modeling
	
	                  component; it also focused on the evaluation of
	the
	
	                  usability and user acceptance of the system. The
	
	                  results of the experiments are satisfactory and
	
	                  support the choice of a user model-based approach
	to
	
	                  information filtering on the Web.

	with which they were working, classify the documents that they

	                  to personalize their user interaction. Adaptive
	
	                  systems are generally better able to cater to users
	
	                  the more data their user modeling systems collect
	
	                  and process about them. They therefore gather as
	
	                  much data as possible and  lay them in stock  for
	
	                  possible future usage. Moreover, data collection
	
	                  usually takes place without users  initiative and
	
	                  sometimes even without their awareness, in order

	                  privacy concerns that became manifest in numerous
	
	                  recent consumer polls, and with data protection

	                  consent when personal data are collected and
	
	                  processed. This article discusses security
	
	                  requirements to guarantee privacy in user-adaptive
	
	                  systems and explores ways to keep users anonymous
	
	                  while fully preserving personalized interaction
	with
	
	                  them. User anonymization in personalized systems
	
	                  goes beyond current models in that not only users
	
	                  must remain anonymous, but also the user modeling
	
	                  system that maintains their personal data. Moreover,
	
	                  users  trust in anonymity can be expected to lead
	to
	
	                  more extensive and frank interaction, hence to more
	
	                  and better data about the user, and thus to better
	
	                  personalization. A reference model for pseudonymous
	
	                  and secure user modeling is presented that meets
	
	                  many of the proposed requirements.},

	                  with their personal interests. In these systems,
	
	                  machine learning methods are often used to acquire
	
	                  the user interest profile. Frequently user interests
	
	                  drift with time. The ability to adapt fast to the
	
	                  current user's interests is an important feature
	for
	
	                  recommender systems. This paper presents a method
	
	                  for dealing with drifting interests by introducing
	
	                  the notion of gradual forgetting. Thus, the last

	                  importance of an observation should decrease with

	                  is able to improve the prediction accuracy on

	                  activity. So, adaptive television needs to adapt

	                  groups of users rather than to individual users.
	In
	
	                  this paper, we discuss di¡erent strategies for
	
	                  combining individual user models to adapt to groups,
	
	                  some of which are inspired by Social Choice
	
	                  Theory. In a first experiment, we explore how humans
	
	                  select a sequence of items for a group to watch,
	
	                  based on data about the individuals
	
	                  preferences. The results show that humans use some
	
	                  of the strategies such as the Average Strategy
	
	                  (a.k.a. Additive Utilitarian), the Average Without
	
	                  Misery Strategy and the Least Misery Strategy, and
	
	                  care about fairness and avoiding individual
	
	                  misery. In a second experiment, we investigate how
	
	                  satisfied people believe they would be with sequences
	
	                  chosen by different strategies, and how their
	
	                  satisfaction corresponds with that predicted by
	a
	
	                  number of satisfaction functions. The results show
	
	                  that subjects use normalization, deduct misery,
	and
	
	                  use the ratings in a non-linear way. One of the
	
	                  satisfaction functions produced reasonable, though
	
	                  not completely correct predictions. According to
	our
	
	                  subjects, the sequences produced by five strategies
	
	                  give satisfaction to all individuals in the
	
	                  group. The results also show that subjects put more
	
	                  emphasis than expected on showing the best rated
	
	                  item to each individual (at a cost of misery for
	
	                  another individual), and that the ratings of the
	
	                  first and last items in the sequence are especially
	
	                  important. In a final experiment, we explore the
	
	                  influence viewing an item can have on the ratings
	of
	
	                  other items. This is important for deciding the
	
	                  order in which to present items. The results show

	In many cases the
	
	most appropriate way for users to teach is to demonstrate examples.
	Learning complex
	
	concepts from examples alone is hard, but agents can exploit other
	forms of instruction
	
	that users might give, ranging from yes/no responses to ambiguous,
	incomplete hints.
	
	Agents can also exploit background knowledge customized for applications
	such as
	
	drawing, word processing and form-filling.
	
	The Cima system learns generalized rules for classifying, generating,
	and modifying data,
	
	given examples, hints, and background knowledge. It copes with the
	ambiguity of user
	
	instructions by combining evidence from these sources. A dynamic bias
	manager
	
	generates candidate features (attribute values, functions or relations)
	from which the
	
	learning algorithm selects relevant ones and forms appropriate rules.
	When tested on
	
	dialogues observed in a prior user study on a simulated interface
	agent, the system
	
	achieved 95% of the learning efficiency observed in that study.},

	A novel ontology-based approach to recommendation is applied to a

	                  Internet has been increasing rapidly, especially
	
	                  since the advent of electronic commerce. In this
	
	                  context, we argue here for the usefulness of
	
	                  constructing communities of users with common
	
	                  behaviour, making use of machine learning
	
	                  techniques. In particular, we assume that the users
	
	                  of any service on the Internet constitute a large
	
	                  community and we aim to construct smaller
	
	                  communities of users with common
	
	                  characteristics. The paper presents the results

	                  three case studies for three different types of
	
	                  Internet service: a digital library, an information
	
	                  broker and a Web site. Particular attention is paid
	
	                  on the different types of information access
	
	                  involved in the three case studies: query-based
	
	                  information retrieval, profilebased information
	
	                  filtering and Web-site navigation. Each type of
	
	                  access imposes different constraints on the
	
	                  representation of the learning task. Two different
	
	                  unsupervised learning methods are evaluated:
	
	                  conceptual clustering and cluster mining. One of

	This viewpoint is under-emphasized in
	
	the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a connection-oriented

	systems research. We posit that recommendation has an inherently social
	element and is ultimately intended
	
	to connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling

	                  these needs through a comprehensive overview of
	
	                  logic-based representation and reasoning in user
	
	                  modeling system. Then, the AsTRa (Assumption Type
	
	                  Representation) framework for logicbased user model
	
	                  representation and reasoning is presented. This
	
	                  framework obtains its power and flexibility through
	
	                  an integration of the two main scientific approaches
	
	                  that were pursued to date, namely the partition
	
	                  approach and the modal logic approach. The central
	
	                  notion of the framework is the  assumption type
	, a
	
	                  partition-like partial knowledge base for storing
	
	                  all assumptions about the user that are of the same
	
	                  type.Within assumption types, logic-based
	
	                  representation formalisms can be employed. The
	
	                  semantics of assumption types and content formalisms
	
	                  can be characterized in terms of modal logic, so
	
	                  that an extension to full modal logic is
	
	                  possible. Moreover, special mechanisms for handling
	
	                  so-called  negative assumptions  are developed,

	                  the enormous volume of information available to
	
	                  them. One crucial unsolved problem for recommender
	
	                  systems is how best to learn about a new user. In
	
	                  this paper we study six techniques that
	
	                  collaborative filtering recommender systems can
	use
	
	                  to learn about new users. These techniques select

	                  sequence of items for the collaborative filtering
	
	                  system to present to each new user for rating. The
	
	                  techniques include the use of information theory
	to
	
	                  select the items that will give the most value to
	
	                  the recommender system, aggregate statistics to

  abstract = {Knowledge Management Systems (KMSs) are information systems dedicated
	to manage
	
	organizational knowledge with the purpose to increase the productivity
	of their knowledge
	
	workers. Although a lot of KMSs have been recently developed, to date
	user modeling
	
	issues in KMSs have not been treated in depth either in user modeling
	literature or in the
	
	literature related to KMSs. The thesis explores the role of user models
	and user modeling in
	
	KMSs. The main contributions of the thesis are: (1) identifying aspects
	of user modeling
	
	relevant to KMSs, (2) integrating them in a generic framework based
	on ontologies (3)
	
	illustrating how user modeling can be applied in KMSs.
	
	The thesis proposes an advanced user model implemented as a user ontology
	using
	
	Semantic Web technology. The user ontology is conceptualized based
	on an extended
	
	Information Management Systems Learner Information Package (IMS LIP)
	specification in
	
	order to be generic and reusable in different application domains.
	Specific characteristics of
	
	the users interacting with a KMS such as: level_of_knowledge sharing,
	type_of_activity and
	
	level_of_activity have been identified, modeled and grouped under
	the Behavior concept.
	
	The Behavior concept extends the structure of IMS LIP.
	
	Briefly, we show that the integration of user models and user modeling
	processes in a KMS
	
	enables: personalized interaction, advanced support for learning &
	change, support for
	
	networking & collaboration and expertise discovery.
	
	The user ontology and the user modeling processes are part of ontology-based
	user
	
	modeling framework (OntobUMf). OntobUMf is a user modeling server
	implemented using
	
	Java 2 (sdk 1.4.1), JSPs technology and KAON tool suite as a framework
	for managing
	
	ontologies. A concrete example of the use of OntobUMf in an ontology-based
	KMS is
	
	given; but the framework can be easily adapted to other ontology-aware
	environments.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) is learning through
	
	                  direct experimentation. It does not assume the
	
	                  existence of a teacher that provides examples upon
	
	                  which learning of a task takes place. Instead, in
	RL
	
	                  experience is the only teacher. With historical
	
	                  roots on the study of biological conditioned
	
	                  reflexes, RL attracts the interest of Engineers
	and
	
	                  Computer Scientists because of its theoretical
	
	                  relevance and potential applications in fields as
	
	                  diverse as Operational Research and Intelligent
	
	                  Robotics. Computationally, RL is intended to operate
	
	                  in a learning environment composed by two subjects:
	
	                  the learner and a dynamic process. At successive
	
	                  time steps, the learner makes an observation of
	the
	
	                  process state, selects an action and applies it
	back to the process. Its goal
	
	                  is to find out an action policy that controls the
	
	                  behavior of the dynamic process, guided by signals
	
	                  (reinforcements) that indicate how badly or well
	it
	
	                  has been performing the required task. These signals
	
	                  are usually associated to a dramatic condition
	
	                  e.g., accomplishment of a subtask (reward)
	
	                  or complete failure (punishment), and the learner
	
	                  tries to optimize its behavior by using a
	
	                  performance measure (a function of the received
	
	                  reinforcements). The crucial point is that in order
	
	                  to do that, the learner must evaluate the conditions
	
	                  (associations between observed states and chosen
	
	                  actions) that led to rewards or
	
	                  punishments. Starting from basic concepts, this

	                  develops the corresponding mathematical tools,

	                  relationships between different items, and then
	use
	
	                  these relationships to indirectly compute
	
	                  recommendations for users. In this paper we analyze
	
	                  different item-based recommendation generation
	
	                  algorithms. We look into different techniques for
	
	                  computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item
	
	                  correlation vs. cosine similarities between item
	
	                  vectors) and different techniques for obtaining
	
	                  recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum
	
	                  vs. regression model). Finally, we experimentally
	
	                  evaluate our results and compare them to the basic
	
	                  k-nearest neighbor approach. Our experiments suggest
	
	                  that item-based algorithms provide dramatically
	
	                  better performance than user-based algorithms, while
	
	                  at the same time providing better quality than the
	
	                  best available user-based algorithms.},

	the user, discovering how the
	
	user wants to be assisted in different contexts. As a result of our

	the components of a user interaction profile that models a user?s

  abstract = {As Digital TV subscribers are offered more and more
	
	                  channels, it is becoming increasingly difficult
	for
	
	                  them to locate the right programme information at
	
	                  the right time.The personalized Electronic Programme
	
	                  Guide (pEPG) is one solution to this problem; it
	
	                  leverages artificial intelligence and user profiling
	
	                  techniques to learn about the viewing preferences
	of
	
	                  individual users in order to compile personalized
	
	                  viewing guides that fit their individual
	
	                  preferences. Very often the limited availability
	of
	
	                  profiling information is a key limiting factor in
	
	                  such personalized recommender systems. For example,
	
	                  it is well known that collaborative filtering
	
	                  approaches su¡er significantly from the sparsity
	
	                  problem, which exists because the expected
	
	                  item-overlap between profiles is usually very low.
	In
	
	                  this article we address the sparsity problem in
	the
	
	                  Digital TV domain. We propose the use of datamining
	
	                  techniques as away of supplementing meagre
	
	                  ratings-based profile knowledge with additional
	
	                  item-similarity knowledge that can be automatically
	
	                  discovered by mining user profiles. We argue that
	this
	
	                  new similarity knowledge can significantlyenhance
	the
	
	                  performance ofa recommender system in even the
	
	                  sparsest of profile spaces. Moreover, we provide

	                  empirical study of a simulated filtering system

	                  control. The first issue concerns if a

	                  performance if generated from an initial explicit

	                  adapted profile. Finally, the relationship between
	
	                  filtering performance and user ratings is
	
	                  investigated. In this particular study the initial

	                  profile filtering performance, and only weak

	                  Mark Weiser described a tantalizing destination

	                  over a decade ago. In a seminal article, "The
	
	                  Computer for the 21st Century," he described a
	
	                  hypothetical world in which humans and computers
	
	                  were seamlessly united. The article's opening words
	
	                  are memorable:
	
	
	                  \emph{The most profound technologies are those that
	
	                  disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric

	                  everyday life until they are indistinguishable from
	
	                  it.}
	
	
	                  He called this vision ubiquitous computing. Its
	
	                  essence was the creation of environments saturated
	
	                  with computing and communication yet gracefully
	
	                  integrated with human users.
	
	
	                  When articulated, this was a vision far ahead of

	                  simply did not exist. Not surprisingly, the
	
	                  implementation attempted by Weiser and his
	
	                  colleagues at Xerox Parc fell short. After a decade

	information
	
	society and it has become even more important since the advent of
	the Web. On
	
	one hand, our society relies more and more on information, both for
	professional
	
	and personal goals. Information is nowadays considered as one of the
	most valuable
	
	and strategic goods: knowing the right information, at the right moment,
	
	as soon as it is available is a ?must? for all of us. On the other
	hand, the amount
	
	of available information, especially on the Web and in modern Digital
	Libraries,
	
	is increasing tremendously over time.
	
	In this context, the importance and role of user modeling and personalized
	
	information access are increasing. Equipped with user modeling tools
	capable of
	
	comprehending specific user information needs, new retrieval tools
	will be able
	
	to effectively filter out irrelevant information, to rank information
	in the most
	
	suitable way, to compare the contents of different documents, to personalize
	
	information presentation, and to adequately tailor man-machine interaction.
	
	The new challenges have motivated a range of new technologies for
	personalized
	
	information access within all information access paradigms ? from
	classic
	
	?ad-hoc? information retrieval to information filtering, browsing,
	presentation,
	
	and visualization. New creative ideas have emerged in a number of
	old and new
	
	research communities including user modeling, machine learning, adaptive
	hypermedia,
	
	digital libraries, the Semantic Web, human-computer interaction, and

  abstract = {In building effective interfaces or computer human interaction devices,
	a main limitation
	
	of traditional presentation design is the inability to meet individual
	user expectation
	
	at run-time. On-line design of individualised presentations that surpass
	the limits
	
	of the ?one size fits all? approaches can be made possible by user
	modeling techniques.
	
	Building models of users can be done throughMachine Learning, but
	this requires techniques
	
	that are specific to the task.One particular issue is that the user
	models cannot
	
	remain static, in the sense that during the use of the intended interaction
	more knowledge
	
	can be gathered which should in turn be used to improve the user models.
	The
	
	knowledge from which the construction of the models can be made is
	many-fold: web
	
	logs, speech, images...
	
	Machine learning is needed in order to construct the initialmodel,
	to allow reactivity
	
	and adaptivity, to build clusters of users, to allow the interface
	to find out more about
	
	the users, even if this does not pay off in the short term.

	a Network of Excellence launched in January 2004 in the context of

	Framework. 56 research teams participate in this network whose primary
	objective is

	                  information need. The list is usually very short
	for
	
	                  ad hoc querying and longer for information filtering
	
	                  tasks. Information systems that could benefit from
	
	                  having a user model should be able to adapt to
	
	                  individual users, to learn about their preferences
	
	                  and attitudes during the interaction (to construct
	a
	
	                  user profile), and memorize them for later
	
	                  use. Moreover, these user profiles could represent
	a
	
	                  starting point for the creation of user communities
	
	                  based on shared interests or goals. Further, the
	
	                  system should be able to update its model is a user
	
	                  changes interests. Machine Learning (ML) is
	
	                  concerned with the formation of models from
	
	                  observations. Hence, learning algorithms seem to
	be
	
	                  promising candidates for user model acquisition
	
	                  systems. Information Retrieval (IR) is concerned
	
	                  with the study of systems for representing,
	
	                  organising, retrieving and delivering information
	
	                  based on content. User modeling is the glue. As
	the
	
	                  better we model users, the better we can satisfy
	
	                  their information needs. We also aim to provide
	a
	
	                  forum for researchers who are not necessarily
	
	                  familiar with the diverse aspects of UM/ML/IR to
	be
	
	                  able to get acquainted with the possibilities of
	
	                  collaboration between the communities. Thus, our
	
	                  main goal is to build further bridges between three
	
	                  communities: User Modeling, Machine Learning, and
	
	                  Information Retrieval. We welcome your contributions
	
	                  to addressing these issues. Our main goal is to
	
	                  build further bridges between three communities:
	
	                  User Modeling, Machine Learning, and Information
	
	                  Retrieval.},
