	                  that delay step-ordering decisions as long as
	
	                  possible are more efficient that those that
	
	                  manipulate totally ordered sequences of actions,
	
	                  this intuition has received little formal
	
	                  justification or empirical validation. In this paper
	
	                  we do both, characterizing the types of domains
	that
	
	                  offer performance differentiation and the features
	
	                  that distinguish the relative overhead of three
	
	                  planning algorithms. As expected, the partial-order
	
	                  (nonlinear) planner often has an advantage when
	
	                  confronted with problems which the specific order
	of
	
	                  the plan steps is critical. We argue that the
	
	                  observed performance differences are best understood
	
	                  with an extension of Korf's taxonomy of subgoal
	
	                  collections. Each planner quickly solved problems
	
	                  whose subgoals were independent or trivially
	
	                  serializable, but problems with laboriously
	
	                  serializable or nonserializable subgoals were
	
	                  intractable for all planners. Since different plan
	
	                  representations induce distinct search spaces, the
	
	                  subgoals for a given problem may be trivially
	
	                  serializable for one planner, laboriously
	
	                  serializable for another, and nonserializable for
	a
	
	                  third. We contend that the partial-order
	
	                  representation yields superior performance because
	
	                  it more frequently results in trivial serializability.},

	The protocol, called the Open Knowledge Base Connectivity (OKBC),
	provides a set of operations for a generic interface to underlying
	KRSs. The interface layer allows an application some independence
	from the idiosyncrasies of specific KRS software and enables the
	development of generic tools (e.g., graphical browsers and editors)
	that operate on many KRSs. OKBC implementations exist for several
	programming languages, including Java, C (client implementation only),
	and Common Lisp, and provide access to KBs both locally and over
	a network.
	
	
	 OKBC is complementary to language specifications developed to support
	knowledge sharing. KIF [4], the Knowledge Interchange Format, provides
	a declarative language for describing knowledge. As a pure specification
	language, KIF does not include commands for knowledge base query
	or manipulation. Furthermore, KIF is far more expressive than most
	KRSs. OKBC focuses on operations that are efficiently supported by
	most KRSs (e.g., operations on frames, slots, facets -- inheritance
	and slot constraint checking). OKBC is intended to be well impedance-matched
	to the sorts of operations typically performed by applications that
	view or manipulate object-oriented KRS},

	manufacturing conceptsand terms, because ontologies provide a way
	to make explicit the semantics (i.e., the meaning)for the concepts
	used, rather than relying just on the syntax used to encode those
	concepts.Ontological techniques can be useful for giving unambiguous
	definitions of product and pro-cess capabilities and evolving designs
	and design requirements, unifying the differences in howknowledge
	is conceptualized across multiple product and process domains, and
	translating thosedefinitions into the specialized representation
	languages of application systems.This paper gives an overview of
	current research and development on ontologies as it relatesto mechanical
	engineering applications, along with examples of how ontologies can
	be used tofacilitate the exchange of information among manufacturing

	that enable renaming of non-logical symbols from multiple component
	ontologies and that provide unambiguous mapping between words and
	text strings disambiguate symbol references during input and output.
	These features of Ontolingua support cyclic inclusion graphs and

	This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are

	while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate
	from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining
	system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency
	of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed

	                  seem to have been much more interested in the nature
	
	                  of reasoning rather than in the nature of the real
	
	                  world. Recently, however, the potential value of
	
	                  task-independent knowlege bases (or ontologies)
	
	                  suitable to large scale integration has been
	
	                  underlined in many ways. In this paper, we compare
	
	                  the dichotomy between reasoning and representation
	
	                  to the philosophical distinction between
	
	                  epistemology and ontology. We introduce the notion
	
	                  of the ontological level, intermediate between the
	
	                  epistemological and the conceptual level discussed
	
	                  by Brachman, as a way to characterize a knowledge
	
	                  representation formalism taking into account the
	
	                  intended meaning of its primitives. We then discuss
	
	                  some formal ontological distinctions which may play
	
	                  an important role for such purpose.},

	                  events and time within a logic programming
	
	                  framework. The notion of event is taken to be more
	
	                  primitive than that of time and both are represented
	
	                  explicity by means of Horn clauses augmented with
	
	                  negation by failure. The main intended applications
	
	                  are the updating of databases and narrative
	
	                  understanding. In contrast with conventional
	
	                  databases which assume that updates are made in
	the
	
	                  same order as the corresponding events occur in
	the
	
	                  real world, the explicit treatment of events allows
	
	                  us to deal with updates which provide information
	
	                  about the past. Default reasoning on the basis of
	
	                  incomplete information is obtained as a consequence

	                  are automatically withdrawn if the addition of new
	
	                  information renders them inconsistent. Because
	
	                  events are differentiated from times, we can
	
	                  represent events with unknown times, as well as
	
	                  events which are partially ordered and concurrent.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel semantics for logic
	
	                  programs with negation by viewing the application
	of
	
	                  a clause in a derivation as an action in the
	
	                  situation calculus. Program clauses are then
	
	                  identified with situation calculus effect axioms
	as
	
	                  they are understood in axiomatic theories of
	
	                  actions. We then solve the frame problem for these
	
	                  effect axioms using a recent approach of Reiter,
	and
	
	                  identify the resulting collection of axioms with
	the
	
	                  semantics of the original logic problem. An
	
	                  interesting consequence of this approach is that
	the
	
	                  logic programming negation-as-failure operator
	
	                  inherits its nonmonotonicity from the
	
	                  nonmonotonicity associated with the frame
	
	                  problem. One advantage of our proposal is that like
	
	                  Clark's completion semantics, ours is also
	
	                  formulated explicity in classical logic. To
	
	                  illustrate the usefulness of our semantics, we prove
	
	                  sufficient conditions for two logic programs to
	be
	
	                  equivalent, and use this to verify the correctness
	
	                  of the well-known unfolding program transformation
	
	                  operator. We also discuss applications of this
	
	                  framework to formalizing search control operators
	in
	
	                  logic programming.},

  abstract = {A computer program capable of acting
	
	                  intelligently in the world must have a general
	
	                  representation of the world in terms its inputs
	are
	
	                  interpreted. Desiging such a program requires
	
	                  commitments about what knowledge is and how it is
	
	                  obtained. Thus, some of the major traditional
	
	                  problems of philosophy arise in artificial
	
	                  intelligence.
	
	                  More specifically, we want a computer program that
	
	                  decides what to do by inferring in a formal language
	
	                  that a certain strategy will achieve its assigned
	
	                  goal. This requires formalizing concepts of
	
	                  causality, ability, and knowledge. Such formalisms
	
	                  are also considered in philosophical logic.
	
	                  The first part of the paper begins with a
	
	                  philosophical point of view that seems to arise
	
	                  naturally once we take seriously the idea of
	
	                  actually making an intelligent machine. We go on
	to
	
	                  the notions of metaphysically and epistemologically
	
	                  adequate representations of the world and then to
	an
	
	                  explanation of can, causes, and knows in terms of
	a
	
	                  representation of the world by a system of
	
	                  interacting automata. A proposed resolution of the
	
	                  problem of freewill in a deterministic universe
	and
	
	                  of counterfactual conditional sentences is
	
	                  presented.
	
	                  The second part is mainly concerned with formalisms
	
	                  within which it can be proved that a strategy will
	
	                  achieve a goal. Concepts of situation, fluent,
	
	                  future operator, action, strategy, result of a
	
	                  strategy and knowledge are formalized. A method
	is
	
	                  given of constructing a sentence of first-order
	
	                  logic which will be true in all models of certain
	
	                  axioms if and only if a certain strategy will
	
	                  achieve a certain goal.
	
	                  The third part discusses open problems in extending
	
	                  the formalism of part 2.
	
	                  The fourth part is a review of work in philosophical
	
	                  logic in relation to problems of artificial
	
	                  intelligence and a discussion of previous efforts
	to
	
	                  program "general intelligence" from the point of
	
	                  view of this paper.},

	paper extends existing ontological models and traditional frame-based
	formalisms. T his work was motivated by the representational challenges
	posed by the domains of experimental sciences (biology, chemistry,
	physics) and the task of intelligent text retrieval. A detailed ontology
	for the eld of experimental molecular biology is presented, which
	is used to illustrate the need for and application of the features
	of the framework. An extended frame-based formalism is dened to support
	these features. T he ability of the framework to support intelligent
	retrieval from a knowledge base of molecular-biology research papers
	is demonstrated by providing answers to queries that could not be
	fully answered using previous approaches. The extensions to ontological
	framework include: category conversions, processes that change the
	category or identity of their participants ; object histories to
	track substances through a series of experimental processes, including
	category conversions; object complexes, temporary congurations of
	objects with properties of their own; and process complexes, groups
	or sequences of interrelated actions that comprise an experimental
	technique or procedure. Features of the frame-based formalism include:
	slot groups for identifying sets of relations that license common
	inferences; and openller classes that combine knowledge of likely
	slot values with the ability to handle unexpected values. Evaluation
	techniques that are used to assess the adequacy of the ontology are

	potential usefulness in improving the quality of query answering,

	                  description of planning as theorem proving with
	the
	
	                  situation calculus. The most pleasing feature of
	
	                  Green's account was the negligible gap between
	
	                  high-level logical specification and practical
	
	                  implementation. This paper attempts to reinstate
	the
	
	                  ideal of planning via theorem proving in a modern
	
	                  guise. In particular, the paper shows that if we
	
	                  adopt the event calculus as our logical formalism
	
	                  and employ abductive logic programming as our
	
	                  theorem proving technique, then the computation

	                  completeness results for this logic programming

	                  that, if we extend the event calculus in a natural
	
	                  way to accommodate compound actions, then using
	the
	
	                  same abductive theorem proving techniques we can
	
	                  obtain a hierarchical planner.},

	may be in a position to discern the qualities of "virtuality" such
	as are enhanced by information technological devices and to explore
	possible roads to follow in efforts to discover new modes of organizational
	action. The attempt is made to depart from the instrumental approach
	underlying the mainstream of studies concerned with the impact of
	information technology on organizing. Approaching this topic from
	the point of view of the ontological predicates of cybernetic space
	(cyberspace) appears to make it possible, as the paper suggests,

	mode of action, one which is seen as radically transforming current
	views on organizational activities.},

  abstract = {In most real-world reasoning problems, planning and
	
	                  scheduling phases are loosely coupled. For example,
	
	                  in project planning, the user comes up with a task
	
	                  list and schedules it with a scheduling tool like
	
	                  Microsoft Project. One can view automated planning
	
	                  in a similar way in which there is an action
	
	                  selection phase where actions are selected and
	
	                  ordered to reach the desired goals, and a resource
	
	                  allocation phase where enough resources are assigned
	
	                  to ensure the successful execution of the chosen
	
	                  actions. On the other hand, most existing automated
	
	                  planners studied in Artificial Intelligence do not
	
	                  exploit this loose-coupling and perform both action
	
	                  selection and resource assignment employing the
	same
	
	                  algorithm. The current work shows that the above
	
	                  strategy severely curtails the scale-up potential
	of
	
	                  existing state of the art planners which can be
	
	                  overcome by leveraging the loose coupling.
	
	                  Specifically, a novel planning framework called
	
	                  RealPlan is developed in which resource allocation
	
	                  is de-coupled from planning and is handled in a
	
	                  separate scheduling phase. The scheduling problem
	
	                  with discrete resources is represented as a
	
	                  Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) problem, and
	
	                  the planner and scheduler interact either in a
	
	                  master-slave manner or in a peer-peer
	
	                  relationship. In the former, the scheduler simply
	
	                  tries to assign resources to the abstract causal
	
	                  plan passed to it by the planner and returns
	
	                  success. In the latter, a more sophisticated
	
	                  multi-module dependency directed backtracking
	
	                  approach is used where the failure explanation in
	
	                  the scheduler is translated back to the planner
	and
	
	                  serves as a nogood to direct planner search.
	
	                  RealPlan not only preserves both the correctness
	as
	
	                  well as the quality (measured in length) of the
	plan
	
	                  but also improves efficiency. Moreover, the
	
	                  failure-driven learning of constraints can serve
	as
	
	                  an elegant and effective approach for integrating
	
	                  planning and scheduling systems. Beyond the context
	
	                  of planner efficiency, the current work can be
	
	                  viewed as an important step towards merging planning
	
	                  with real-world problem solving where plan failure
	
	                  during execution can be resolved by undertaking
	only
	
	                  necessary resource re-allocation and not complete
	
	                  re-planning.},

	means of representing real world knowledge for the development of
	database designs, most ontology creation is not carried out systematically.
	To be truly useful, a repository of ontologies, organized by application
	domain is needed, along with procedures for creating and integrating
	ontologies into database design methodologies. This research proposes
	a methodology for creating and managing domain ontologies. An architecture
	for an ontology management system is presented and implemented in
	a prototype. Empirical validation of the prototype demonstrates the

	                  Planning (AI Planning), an active research and

	As
	
	                  a research field, planning can be defined broadly
	as
	
	                  the study of actions and changes, covering topics

	                  algorithms, plan execution and monitoring, plan
	
	                  reuse and learning. Lately there has been a dramatic
	
	                  increase of interest in automatic and semi-automatic
	
	                  planning in AI and other related fields. It has

	                  demonstrated that research in planning is of great

	                  general computer science, engineering, management

  abstract = {In this paper we present a reusable time ontology for large-scale
	knowledge system applications, that is intuitive, expressive, formally
	defined, logically consistent, and ready-to-use. Our underlying time
	theory treats both time points and time intervals as primitive elements
	on a time line, and the ontology contains a class hierarchy, relations,
	axioms and instances built on those primitives. The main contributions
	of this work are the following three. (1) The ontology makes a distinction
	between closed and open intervals, as opposed to many previous time
	ontologies. However we provide flexibility of usage by providing
	two sets of relations on intervals: one that assumes that distinction
	and one that does not. (2) Time granularity is implemented in the
	ontology to facilitate representing time in varying granularity in
	a layered model and switching from or relating one granularity to
	a coarser/finer one. (3) The ontology includes classes for calendar
	months, calendar days and weekdays. The instances of these classes
	have many attributes associated with them that are useful in knowledge
	domains concerning human activities. We also present examples of
	usage of the ontology and comparisons with previous time ontologies.},
