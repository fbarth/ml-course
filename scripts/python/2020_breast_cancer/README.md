# ESPM_ML_BreastCancer

The goal of this exercise is to create 3 separate pipelines, where each has preprocessing, attribute engineering and model fitting.

Results: recall score for 'M' diagnosis is most important parameter.

1. KNN w/ hyperparameter optimization = *0.94372*
2. GradientBoosting w/ hyperparameter optimization = *0.93846*
3. RandomForestClassifier w/ hyperparameter optimization = *0.93846*
